# About Tech Insights

Welcome to **Tech Insights** - a minimalist tech blog focused on embedded systems engineering, IoT platform architecture, and systems programming. My mission is to share practical knowledge and insights that help engineers build scalable, reliable embedded solutions.

## About Kunal Mathur

I'm a software engineer focused on architecting and delivering scalable IoT products and embedded platforms that evolve with growing business and technical requirements. I specialize in C++ development, Embedded Linux systems, and Yocto-based platform engineering.

### My Journey

My passion for technology centers on the intersection of hardware and software - building systems that bridge the physical and digital worlds. I've developed expertise in creating embedded platforms that scale from prototype to production, always with an eye toward maintainability and future growth.

**Current Role**: Software Engineer at Sensormatic (Johnson Controls), where I architect codebases spanning multiple product lines and lead a team of engineers through complex technical challenges while maintaining a strong product focus.

### Technical Expertise

**Programming Languages:**
- **Primary**: C++, Python, Bash
- **Secondary**: JavaScript, Rust, Yocto Recipes, SQL

**Platforms & Hardware:**
- **Embedded**: Embedded Linux, Yocto, BusyBox, Systemd
- **Hardware**: ARM, x86, Edge Devices

**Frameworks & Tools:**
- **Build Systems**: CMake, Yocto BitBake, Bazel (evaluation)
- **Development**: Git, VS Code, Clang, GCC, CMake, GDB
- **Operations**: Docker, Kubernetes (edge orchestration), OTA Update Systems

**Specializations:**
- IoT Platform Architecture
- Embedded Linux Distribution Engineering
- C++ Application Design
- Yocto Build & Layer Strategy
- Cross-Product Codebase Architecture
- Remote Device Management & Observability
- Scalable Update & Deployment Pipelines

### Open Source & Community

I'm passionate about giving back to the embedded systems community:

- **Creator** of [embedded-tools](https://github.com/kunalmathur/embedded-tools) - Development utilities for embedded systems
- **Maintainer** of [yocto-layers](https://github.com/kunalmathur/yocto-layers) - Reusable Yocto layers for IoT platforms
- **Contributor** to OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project, IoT device drivers, and embedded Linux optimizations

### Let's Connect
