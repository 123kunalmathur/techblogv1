# Professional Summary
bio: |
  Software engineer focused on architecting and delivering scalable IoT products and embedded platforms that evolve with growing business and technical requirements.

  I design and build robust C++ and Embedded Linux applications for field deployment, focusing on resource optimization, reliability, and secure remote updates. My experience includes developing Yocto-based distributions, creating reusable platform layers, and establishing patterns that enable multiple product lines to share coherent, maintainable codebases.

  Currently I architect codebases spanning products at Sensormatic (Johnson Controls), leading a team of engineers through technical complexity while maintaining a strong product focus. I consistently seek pragmatic solutions that balance current requirements with future scalability needs.

  I'm continually refining processes around build reproducibility, hardware abstraction, observability, and deployment orchestration—pushing for solutions that stand the test of time.
